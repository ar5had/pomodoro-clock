# pomodoro-clock
This is a web implementation of pomodoro clock which uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named pomodoros. The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility. You can set clock time as well as break time and reset the clock after starting it.
